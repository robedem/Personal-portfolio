        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Roberto Edem, a skilled front-end developer passionate about creating dynamic and user-friendly web experiences. My tech journey began in 2023, shortly after graduating high school, when I learned Python as my first programming language. Captivated by the possibilities of technology, I dove deeper into web development, equipping myself with both front-end and back-end skills.
        </p>

        <p>I’m proficient in JavaScript, React, Python, MySQL, and other modern web technologies. Over the years, I’ve built various projects, ranging from responsive websites to interactive applications, and gained hands-on experience as an intern at several companies. Driven by a desire to continuously learn and innovate, I’m excited to contribute my skills to impactful projects in the ever-evolving tech world.

        </p>
        <p>With experience as a Web Developer Intern at HNG and a Python Programming Intern at Start Innovation Hub, I’ve refined my skills in JavaScript, React, Python, and MySQL. I’ve also delivered multiple web solutions for private clients, showcasing my ability to build impactful projects. Currently, I’m exploring new opportunities to contribute my expertise while spending my spare time coding personal projects and staying updated on the latest tech trends.</p>
